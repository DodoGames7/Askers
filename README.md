* **preview**: Versions that are ready for the public after it's beta circle has been finished. Recommended for use if you want to try the new stuff before final release. Have in mind that Versions in preview state are subject to have some changes before the final release.

Additionally, you can also view the old versions of Askers through [Github Releases](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Askers/tags) and even use them, but we do not recommend using them as we encourage you to use the latest release for good experience with bug fixes (considering that old versions could break by discord api changes as time goes on).

**Which One should i use then**: beta is recommended for only testing or for users who loves to live with bugs, stable is recommended for people who want an smooth experience without any bugs. Preview is for people who wants to see a sneak peak of what's coming in a update of Askers with less buggy experience for new features.
# story
There were a lot of public Akinator bot projects, but most of them didn't let you change the settings. If they did, it would be by changing the code, not by using a command in a Discord server. This project was somewhat experimental that I wasn't planning on starting it, since I'm already maintaining other bots like [Kirbo](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Kirbo), [Dodo-Bot](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Dodo-Bot), and soon Epik-Man. But I really wanted to make the Akinator game experience much better by letting users customize it without any problems.


# using the bot without setting up
Don't want to setup the bot? Fortunately, you can invite the public version of this bot by clicking on this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=860567781925322759&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=11264).

Alternatively, you can also invite our beta bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1054770273779470437&permissions=11264&scope=bot).

Note: in case if you're confused, the prefix is the same as the one used in Asker's source code aka `a!`. In the beta bot, it's `a?` instead.
