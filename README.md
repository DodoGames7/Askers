* **main**: The default branch of this Repo, usually the place where stable versions are shown to the public.
* **beta**: An place where the upcoming versions takes place in to be developed with some beta builds regularly.
* **preview**: Versions that are ready for the public after it's beta circle has been finished. Recommended for use if you want to try the new stuff before final release. Have in mind that Versions in preview state are subject to have some changes before the final release.

Additionally, you can also view the old versions of Askers through [Github Releases](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Askers/tags) and even use them, but we do not recommend using them as we encourage you to use the latest release for good experience with bug fixes (considering that old versions could break by discord api changes as time goes on).

**Which One should i use then**: beta is recommended for only testing or for users who loves to live with bugs, stable is recommended for people who want an smooth experience without any bugs. Preview is for people who wants to see a sneak peak of what's coming in a update of Askers with less buggy experience for new features.
# story
there have been many public akinator bot projects but rarely any of them allowed you to change their settings and even if it had then it would be simply in code but not through a command used in a discord server, this project was somewhat experimental that i wasn't planning on starting it since i'm maintaining other bots such as  [Kirbo](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Kirbo), [Dodo-Bot](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Dodo-Bot) and lastly reviving epik-man sooner but i kinda wanted to make akinator experience much better allowing the user to have freedom in customising the game without any of single issues!

# using the bot without setting up

Alternatively, you can also invite our beta bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1054770273779470437&permissions=11264&scope=bot).

Note: in case if you're confused, the prefix is the same as the one used in Asker's source code aka `a!`. In the beta bot, it's `a?` instead.
