# Important
Be aware that you can get very high ram usage for some reason. This is not Asker's fault because the stuff Askers uses to function is experiencing some problems considering that it's affecting all other akinator bots as well. Unfortunately, i have no control over that so bear with me on that. Note that this is also affecting older versions of Askers due to the api issue so it's not an option to use them either.

# Askers
aoi.js v6 akinator bot with options to customize the game

# Features
* a settings command to change on how the game should start, e.g changing modes, button mode, etc
* start the game easily with just one command!
* change the language to other than just English! (supports many Languages!)

# story
there have been many public akinator bot projects but rarely any of them allowed you to change their settings and even if it had then it would be simply in code but not through a command used in a discord server, this project was somewhat experimental that i wasn't planning on starting it since i'm maintaining other bots such as  [Kirbo](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Kirbo), [Dodo-Bot](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Dodo-Bot) and lastly reviving epik-man sooner but i kinda wanted to make akinator experience much better allowing the user to have freedom in customising the game without any of single issues!

# using the bot without setting up
don't want to setup the bot?, fortunately you can invite the public version of this bot by clicking on this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=860567781925322759&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=11264)
