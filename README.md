# Askers
aoi.js v6 akinator bot with options to customize the game

# Features
* a settings command to change on how the game should start, e.g changing modes, button mode, etc
* start the game easily with just one command!
* change the language to other than just English! (supports many Languages!)

# what are the versions available on this Github Repo?
* **main**: the default branch of this Repo. usually the place where stable versions are shown to the public.
* **beta**: an place where the upcoming versions takes place in to be developed with some beta builds regularly.

additionally you can also view the old versions of Askers through [Github Releases](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Askers/releases) and even use them but we do not recommend using them as we encourage you to use the latest release for good experience with bug fixes (considering that old versions could break by discord api changes as time goes on).

which one i should use then: beta is recommended for only testing or for users who loves to live with bugs, stable is recommended for people who want an smooth experience without any bugs.
# story
there have been many public akinator bot projects but rarely any of them allowed you to change their settings and even if it had then it would be simply in code but not through a command used in a discord server, this project was somewhat experimental that i wasn't planning on starting it since i'm maintaining other bots such as  [Kirbo](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Kirbo), [Dodo-Bot](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Dodo-Bot) and lastly reviving epik-man sooner but i kinda wanted to make akinator experience much better allowing the user to have freedom in customising the game without any of single issues!

# using the bot without setting up

Note: in case if you're confused, the prefix is the same as the one used in Asker's source code aka `a!`
