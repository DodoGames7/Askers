# story
there have been many public akinator bot projects but rarely any of them allowed you to change their settings and even if it had then it would be simply in code but not through a command used in a discord server, this project was somewhat experimental that i wasn't planning on starting it since i'm maintaining other bots such as  [Kirbo](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Kirbo), [Dodo-Bot](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Dodo-Bot) and lastly reviving epik-man sooner but i kinda wanted to make akinator experience much better allowing the user to have freedom in customising the game without any of single issues!

# using the bot without setting up
don't want to setup the bot?, fortunately you can invite the public version of this bot by clicking on this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=860567781925322759&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=11264)

Note: in case if you're confused, the prefix is the same as the one used in Asker's source code aka `a!`
