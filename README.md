# Important
Be aware that you can get very high ram usage for some reason. This is not Asker's fault because the stuff Askers uses to function is experiencing some problems considering that it's affecting all other akinator bots as well. Unfortunately, i have no control over that so bear with me on that.

# Askers
Aoi.js v6 akinator bot with options to customize the game.

# Features
* A settings command to change on how the game should start, e.g changing modes, button mode, etc
* Start the game easily with just one command!
* Change the language to other than just English! (supports many Languages!)

# what are the versions available on this Github Repo?
* **main**: The default branch of this Repo, usually the place where latest stable versions are shown to the public.
* **beta**: An place where the alpha versions turns into beta and takes place in to be actively worked on with some beta builds regularly.
* **alpha**: Versions that are not ready for the public as they're too experimental after being created. Recommended only if you don't mind having bugs with the bot at all.
* **[v1.2](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Askers/tree/v1.2)**: The continued support for version 1.0.2 with regular bug fixes. No new changes or anything else.

Additionally, you can also view the old versions of Askers through [Github Releases](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Askers/tags) and even use them, but we do not recommend using them as we encourage you to use the latest release for good experience with bug fixes (considering that old versions could break by discord api changes as time goes on).

**Which one should i use then**: 
* For beta:
> Beta is recommended for only testing or for users who loves to live with less bugs.
* For stable (aka main):
> Stable is recommended for people who wants an smooth experience without any bugs. 
* For alpha:
> Alpha is for people who wants to try experimental unstable versions of Askers accepting the risks of lot of bugs.
* For v1.2:
> Only if you don't like 1.0.3 for whatever reason and want to continue using 1.0.2 with regular bug fixes.
# story
There were a lot of public Akinator bot projects, but most of them didn't let you change the settings. If they did, it would be by changing the code, not by using a command in a Discord server. This project was somewhat experimental that I wasn't planning on starting it, since I'm already maintaining other bots like [Kirbo](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Kirbo), [Dodo-Bot](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Dodo-Bot), and soon Epik-Man. But I really wanted to make the Akinator game experience much better by letting users customize it without any problems.


# using the bot without setting up
Don't want to setup the bot? Fortunately, you can invite the public version of this bot by clicking on this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=860567781925322759&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=11264).

Alternatively, you can also invite our beta bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1054770273779470437&permissions=11264&scope=bot).

Note: in case if you're confused, the prefix is the same as the one used in Asker's source code aka `a!`. In the beta bot, it's `a?` instead.
